Grails 3.3 introduces a new Events API that replaces the previous implementation that was based on Reactor 2.x (which is no longer maintained and deprecated by Pivotal).

In Grails 3.3 and above a new link:{api}/grails/events/bus/EventBus.html[EventBus] abstraction has been introduced. Like the `PromiseFactory` notion, there are implementations of the `EventBus` interface for common asynchronous frameworks like GPars and RxJava.

If no asynchronous framework in present on the classpath then by default Grails creates an EventBus based off of the currently active `PromiseFactory`. The default implementation is link:{api}/org/grails/async/factory/future/CachedThreadPoolPromiseFactory.html[CachedThreadPoolPromiseFactory] which uses a thread pool that will create threads as needed (the same as `java.util.concurrent.Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`).

If you wish to use a popular async framework such as RxJava as the `EventBus` implementation then you will need to add the appropriate dependency. For example for RxJava 1.x:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
.build.gradle
----
runtime "org.grails:grails-events-rxjava:{version}"
----

The following table summarizes async framework support and the necessary dependency:

.EventBus Implementations
|===
|Framework | Dependency | Implementation Class

|GPars 1.2.x
|`grails-events-gpars`
|`org.grails.events.gpars.ActorEventBus`

|RxJava 1.2.x
|`grails-events-rxjava`
|`org.grails.events.rxjava.RxEventBus`

|RxJava 2.0.x
|`grails-events-rxjava2`
|`org.grails.events.rxjava2.RxEventBus`
